# OV7670-Stm32F070Rb

USING OV7670 WITH NUCLEO STM32F070RB

Main goal of this project is using OV7670( without FIFO)
 * using STM32F070RB and it consumes very less place in the SRAM. Every peripheral clock speed is set 48MHz.
 * Display Rendering Time approximately 2 second.
 * If you have using another board please check your System Clock and PWM setting to be 48MHz and (24Mhz for PWM).
